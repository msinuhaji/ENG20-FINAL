                <p>Hi there.</p>
                <p>I'm Mushthafa Sinuhaji. I've had a keen interest in
                    computers and math, and software for a while. I even taught myself several programming languages:
                    currently, I know Javascript, Lua, HTML, CSS, and Python (which I'm forgetting). I've also used PHP
                    and
                    C++ in the past.</p>
                <p>When I first heard that the English final
                    assignment could be about almost anything, I realized that I had to do something creative
                    and ambitious (and pretentious). I immediately thought of AI—it would be really interesting, and I
                    could
                    ask my dad for help (he did his PhD on Neural Networks for Mining Engineering ~15 years ago,
                    although he
                    never finished it).</p>
                <p>Finally, I decided that I would make an AI that processes images, not some chatbot...</p>

                <p>...When I said I made an AI, did you think of ChatGPT-like AIs?</p>
                <p>I don't blame you. It would be really impressive if some random teenager made another
                    Deepseek. (Unfortunately, you'd need a gazillion dollars to even train the thing.)

                    But no, I didn't make a chatbot like ChatGPT; I made a Convolutional Neural Network.

                    In the world of Machine Learning (where algorithms do tasks without explicit programming to do so),
                    the
                    most popular 'archetype' of the AI is the Neural Network.

                    Essentially, it is an algorithm designed to mimic
                    a simplified brain using basic processing units, called 'Neurons'.

                    ChatGPT is an LLM (Large Language Model) that is built off Transformer Neural Network, specifically
                    designed to process language data. On the other hand, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are the
                    architecture
                    that build Image Processing Models such as YOLO or AlexNet, finding patterns within the images.

            <div style="grid-row: 4/12; grid-column: 5/7;">
                <p>To understand how my CNN would work, we first have to understand how any Neural Network works:</p>
                <p>
                    Simply put, a Neural Network is an arrangement of basic processing units, 'Neurons', into layers in
                    order to approximate a function; it defines a function without the definition of that
                    function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you imagine a graph as a string that bends and twists, a Neural Network would
                    be an approximation of that string, with the Neurons doing the bending and twisting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As previously stated, a CNN is a modified Neural Network. The only major difference is that its made
                    up of three layers, two of which (CL and FCL) being standalone Neural Networks. You can learn more
                    about CNNs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" class="blue-link">here</a>.
